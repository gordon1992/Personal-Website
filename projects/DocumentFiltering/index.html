    <h3>GPU-Accelerated Document Filtering in OpenCL</h3>
    <a href="https://github.com/gordon1992/Level4Project">Github</a>
    <p>Document filtering a is problem of growing importance. The advent of the Internet has resulted in a massive surge
        in the transfer and storage of data and information. A prime example is email where hundreds of billions are
        sent every day. Emails, and other kinds of documents, require to be filtered. This problem is highly data
        parallel in nature as the classification of one document does not affect the classification of another. The
        project investigates the viability of using GPUs rather than CPUs for the classification. GPUs are designed with
        parallel problems in mind and thus have the potential to allow for significantly higher throughput compared with
        CPUs.</p>

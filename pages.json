      "project_description": "Document filtering a is problem of growing importance. The advent of the Internet has resulted in a massive surge in the transfer and storage of data and information. A prime example is email where hundreds of billions are sent every day. Emails, and other kinds of documents, require to be filtered. This problem is highly data parallel in nature as the classification of one document does not affect the classification of another. The project investigates the viability of using GPUs rather than CPUs for the classification. GPUs are designed with parallel problems in mind and thus have the potential to allow for significantly higher throughput compared with CPUs.",

      "project_description": "Climate scientists write a number of applications to simulate aspects of our planet's ecosystem. These are sometimes coupled with other simulations using model coupling frameworks. This improves the accuracy of results and allows climate scientists to model more complicated scenarios. The Glasgow Model Coupling Framework (GMCF) is a new kind of model coupling framework that can also be used to parallelise individual models. By comparing LES performance when parallelised by MPI and GMCF, it is shown that GMCF offers competitive performance with MPI while also providing model coupling functionality.",

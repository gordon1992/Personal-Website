    p Hello, my name is Gordon Reid.
    p I am a graduate from the University of Glasgow living in Falkirk.

        | I will be posting information about my public programming projects on this website. I have experience in
        | many languages including: C, Fortran, Java, and Python. As part of my University course I have created
        | applications using OpenCL, enabling the execution of the algorithm on various classes of device including
        | a GPU and the Intel Xeon Phi, improving performance on a heterogeneous shared-memory system. I have also
        | used MPI and a novel model coupling framework to parallelise a scientific model written in Fortran. The
        | ability to make use of distributed-memory systems has allowed larger area or finer grained areas to be
        | simulated, improving the accuracy of results. More details on all projects are available by visiting the
        | Project page.

        | My #[a(href="/pdf/gordon-reid-cv.pdf") CV] and #[a(href="/pdf/gordon-reid-transcript.pdf") transcript] are
        | available for download.
